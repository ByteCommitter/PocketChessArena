This is a repository for an app, we christined, Pocket Chess Arena,
which is a desktop based GUI for playing chess. The game may be played
online as well on this interface, and is also scalable to any
comfortable size with a number of interesting features.

Feel free to view our outputs, code and more that we documented
for this project at this link:

[I have put up the documentation and screenshots of our output in
two seperate documents in the repository also.]

We created this project using the limited knowledge we had, usefully putting
our time together during the lockdown, and are glad with the outcome!

I am new to github and I might not have done the right
things for a comfortable understanding of our project.
Requesting you to kindly visit the above mentioned website or document 
to view our outputs in case of any difficulty!
Reviews and suggestions on improvement are highly appreciated!
